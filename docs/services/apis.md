# APIs

The Pilot Club has built a few APIs to help the staff and members in club operations. 
The APIs are always a work in progress, so members should check in regularly to verify any changes that have been made.  

## Flight Crew Portal API

The Flight Crew Portal API is the primary way for the TPC Discord Bot and other members to get information that's stored within FCP.
