## More information about Discord Bot v3.0.0
This version of the discord bot is written in a new language (golang) witch is better for our infrastructure and better for member experience.

With that, we have a new team member joining the bot crew, @Flight Engineer Jerry . FEJ is taking over some of the duties that First Officer Kara held, such as plain text commands.

In better terms, v3 is going to replace v2 but we are doing it in stages, starting with plain text commands (ie, sending a specific message to a channel in the discord)
