## v1.0.7
<!-- truncate -->

## New Features for Members
- Added ability to add NON-TPC Callsigns to profiles.
- Added ability for members to add thier birthdays to their profiles so we can wish them a Happy Birthday in the discord on that day :)
    - Added a protected API call so that the bot can read who's birthday is today. This only outputs discord ID and nothing else.

## New Features for Staff

- ADMIN: Added ability to add company perks directly to the site so that they are not longer hard coded

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed bug to where most staff could not see the document section due to hard coded role check
- Fixed a bug where members were not able to see the popover for birthday

## Other Changes

- ADMIN: Added Submitter name and email to the email sent to admin
- Front End: Removed LiveWire from the site due to it causing a bunch of slow down on the site.
- Updated Most tables to use number based id's instead of UUID to improve speed
- Changed Charters Logo on site to match discord and updated other callsigns logo to old charters logo.
- Move Flight Notes to below the map and info box to allow for more space
- Changed the text area on the notes section to allow for more typing and viewing space.
